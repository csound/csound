Csound for iOS

Author: Steven Yi

Build instructions:

Requirements: 
 
  * CMake
  * XCode 4

To build, simply run the build.sh script.  This script was created and tested with OSX 10.7. The build will use CMake to generate an XCode project, then run the build twice via the xcodebuild commandline program.  The two runs will compile libcsound.a for Device and Simulator, then combine the two into a single universal binary containing i386, armv6, and armv7 architectures.
