/* Current memory subsystems work at the granularity of cache lines.
 * Thus concurrent accesses to multiple objects within a cache line
 * can cause additional conflicts and memory subsystem traffic.
 * The best way to avoid this is to pad the structures so that they don't
 * share a cache line.  64 bytes seems to be becoming the usual cache line
 * size.  If the actual line is smaller, it will waste a little memory but
 * shouldn't affect the sharing.  If the actual line is larger then it may
 * cause a few conflicts and thus a performance hit.  Unless you are
 * using a very unusual machine and you happen to know it's cache line size
 * then leave this as 64, although you can try 32 or maybe even 16.
