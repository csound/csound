This ChangeLog tracks changes after Matt Ingalls and Davis Pyon's original
project work was moved into the Csound 6 central repository.


v1.1.1
======

* fixed issues when running in 32-bit mode Max/MSP due to direct accessing of
values in t_atom, rather than using atom_getlong, atom_getfloat, etc.

* fixed invalue channel callback code; caused crashes when invalue opcode was
used
