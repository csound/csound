  /**
   * This class implements a Lindenmayer system that generates a score
   * by moving a turtle around in various implicit music spaces.
   *
   * The turtle consists of:
   * <ul>
   * <li> N, a note, i.e. a vector of real numbers in score space.</li>
   * <li> S, a step, i.e. an increment by which to move N
   *      (also a vector in score space).</li>
   * <li> O, an orientation, i.e. a direction to move N
   *      (also a  vector).</li>
   * <li> C, a chord, i.e. a vector of voices in chord space.</li>
   * <li> M, a modality used as a reference for neo-Riemannian
   *      operations upon chords (also a vector).</li>
   * <li> V, a chord voicing, i.e. the index of the octavewise
   *      permutation of C within a range.</li>
   * <li> B, the bass of the range.</li>
   * <li> R, the size of the range.</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * In accordance with both mathematical music theory and the practice
   * of composers, operations on elements of music take place in spaces
   * whose geometry changes fluidly depending upon the musical context.
   * A paradigmatic example is transposition, which may apply
   * to individual notes, or to chords, or to larger parts of scores;
   * as an even more indicative example, transposition may apply
   * to pitch under octave equivalence (pitch-classes), to pitch under
   * range equivalence (transposition on a staff), or simply to pitch
   * as a real number.
   *
   * Consequently, the independent parts of an operation in this
   * Lindenmayer system are specified by commands in the format
   * OTEDX, where:
   * <ul>
   * <li>O = the operation proper (e.g. sum or product).</li>
   * <li>T = the target, or part of the turtle to which the
   *         operation applies, and which has an implicit rank
   *         (e.g. scalar, vector, tensor).</li>
   * <li>E = its equivalence class (e.g. octave or range).</li>
   * <li>D = the individual dimension of the operation
   *         (e.g. pitch or time).</li>
   * <li>X = the operand.</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * Of course, some operations apply in all ranks, dimensions, and
   * equivalence classes; other operations, only to one dimension
   * or one class.
   *
   * Commands are as follows (x is a real scalar;
   * for chords, v is a real vector "(x1,..,xn)" or a jazz-style chord name ("F#7b9")):
   * <ul>
   * <li> [     = Push the active turtle onto a stack (start a branch).</li>
   * <li> ]     = Pop the active turtle from the stack (return to the branching point).</li>
   * <li> Fx    = Move the turtle "forward" x steps along its current orientation:
   *              N := N + (S * O) * x.</li>
   * <li> ROdex = Rotate the turtle orientation from dimension d to dimension e by angle x:</li>
   *              R = makeRotation(d, e, x); O := R * O.</li>
   * <li> oNEdx = Apply algebraic operation o to turtle note dimension d with operand x:
   *              N[d] := N[d] + S[d] o x.</li>
   * <li> oSEdx = Apply algebraic operation o to turtle step dimension d with operand x:
   *              S[d] := S[d] o x.</li>
   * <li> oCEix = Apply algebraic operation o to voice i of the turtle chord with operand x:
   *              C[i] := C[i] o x.</li>
   * <li> oCEv  = Apply algebraic operation o to the turtle chord with operand x:
   *              C := C o x (x may be a vector or chord name).</li>
   * <li> oMEv  = Apply algebraic operation o to the turtle modality with operand x:
   *              M := M o x (x may be a vector or chord name).</li>
   * <li> oVx =   Apply algebraic operation o to the voicing index of the turtle chord with operand x:
   *              V := V o x. Of necessity the equivalence class is the range of the score.</li>
   * <li> ICOx  = Invert the turtle chord by reflecting it around pitch-class x.</li>
   * <li> KCO   = Apply Neo-Riemannian inversion by exchange to the turtle chord.</li>
   * <li> QCOx  = Apply Neo-Riemannian contextual transposition by x pitch-classes
   *              (with reference to the turtle's modality) to the turtle chord.</li>
   * <li> VC+   = Add a voice (doubling the root) to the turtle chord.</li>
   * <li> VC-   = Remove a voice from the turtle chord.</li>
   * <li> WN    = Write the current turtle note to the score.</li>
   * <li> WCV   = Write the current turtle chord and voicing to the score.</li>
   * <li> WCNV  = Write the current turtle chord and voicing to the score,
   *              after first applying the turtle note to each voice in the chord.</li>
   * <li> AC    = Apply the current turtle chord to the score, starting
   *              at the current time and continuing to the next A command.</li>
   * <li> ACN   = Apply the current turtle chord to the score,
   *              after first applying the turtle note to each voice in the chord, starting
   *              at the current time and continuing to the next A command.</li>
   * <li> ACL   = Apply the current turtle chord to the score, using the closest voice-leading
   *              from the previous chord (if any), starting
   *              at the current time and continuing to the next A command.</li>
   * <li> ACNL  = Apply the current turtle chord to the score, after first applying the turtle
   *              note to each voice in the chord, using the closest voice-leading from the
   *              previous chord (if any), starting
   *              at the current time and continuing to the next A command.</li>
   * <li> A0    = End application of the previous A command.</li>
   * </ul>
   * Dimensions of notes:
   * <ol>
   * <li>i = instrument.</li>
   * <li>t = time.</li>
   * <li>d = duration.</li>
   * <li>k = MIDI key number.</li>

   * <li>y = height.</li>
