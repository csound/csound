	    csoundLoadSoundFIle():
	      loads an entire sound file into memory (similar to ldmemfile())
	* Removed OENTRY.dopadr, and all related code, as it is not really
	  needed now (can use csoundModuleDestroy and RegisterDeinitCallback
	  instead).

	for real-time performance, and the use of 3-dimensional graphics
	for constructing graphical user interfaces.

2005-05-07	Istvan Varga	<istvan@csounds.com>
	* Opcodes/biquad.c:
	* Opcodes/biquad.h:
	  added new optional argument to distort1 opcode (defaults to zero),

	  original version; 1: relative to 0dBFS, same as mode 0 if 0dbfs is
	  32768; 2: unscaled)
	  code changes to improve performance of some opcodes: biquad, vco,
	  pareq, and distort1
	  improved vco opcode for more accurate output
	* Engine/rdorch.c:
	* OOps/aops.c:
	  '=.a' opcode is automatically replaced with 'upsamp' if input is
	  not a-rate, the actual a-rate version has been simplified, and '=' is

	* Top/csound.c:
	* Top/main.c:
	  - maintain a global list of allocated Csound instances, delete
	  all on exit or fatal signal
	  - new interface function: csoundInitialize(), for global
	  initialisation of Csound library; if not done yet, the first
	  call of csoundCreate() will also call csoundInitialize()
	  - moved signal handler from main.c to csound.c (still not quite
	  right, should really be done by host application)
	  - removed some unused/useless static variables

2005-04-30	Istvan Varga	<istvan@csounds.com>
	* removed global variable O - use csound->oparms instead
	* Top/csound.c:
	  - dynamically allocate and destroy Csound instances, rather than
	  using cenviron. Some old code still uses cenviron (and is thus now
	  broken), and should be revised.
	  - made calls to deprecated functions csoundPrintf() (#defined as
	  printf()) and err_printf() fatal errors.

2005-04-29	Istvan Varga	<istvan@csounds.com>
	* removed all static variables from Engine/sread.c

	* Added (very) basic Java GUI front end for Csound.
	It is the main class in CsoundVST.jar. To be extended.
	The purpose of this work is to embed Csound5 in Kandid,
	an interactive graphics program for evolving pictures, and
	adapt Kandid for evolving pieces.

2005-04-18	Istvan Varga	<istvan@csounds.com>

	to a warning.  Trest with care!

2005-04-14  Michael Gogins <gogins@pipeline.com>
	* Changed CsoundVST to print log messages to stderr (used to be
	stdout) by default.
	* Added option to CsoundVST to automatically open the output
	soundfile for editing or listening at end of performance.
	* Upgraded Windows installer to set OPCODEDIR, RAWWAVE_PATH,
	PYTHONPATH, and PATH environment variables
	(uninstall does not work for PYTHONPATH).

2005-04-12  John ffitch  <jpff@codemist.co.uk>

	* Opcodes/wave-terrain.c (wtPerf): Improved phase accumulation problem

2005-04-10  Michael Gogins <gogins@pipeline.com>

2005-04-09  Michael Gogins <gogins@pipeline.com>
	* Added "STKName" (e.g. "STKBowed") opcodes for all Perry Cook's
	Synthesis Toolkit in C++ (STK) 4.2.0 instruments in
	his "demo" program, using Cook's original C++ code
	with minimal wrapping (about 25 opcodes, varying in quality
	from mediocre to very good). To build the opcodes,
	copy the STK sources into the csound5/Opcodes/stk
	directory, as instructed in SConstruct. All opcodes
	have the same signature:
	asignal STKName ifrequency iloudness {kcontroller kvalue}
	The RAWWAVE_PATH environment variable must be set to
	point to the directory containing the "rawwaves" samples.

	  removed BENDSENS (replaced with MYFLT MCHNBLK.pbensens)
	  removed DATENABL (replaced with int MCHNBLK.datenabl)
	* InOut/midifile.c:
	  reduced memory usage of event list
	  do not print any text meta events when message level is zero
	  allow muting tracks with -+mute_tracks option (for example,
	  -+mute_tracks=0010001 will mute the third and seventh tracks;
	  tempo events are still used even if a track is muted)
	* InOut/midirecv.c:
	  allow setting program change to instrument routing per channel
	  implemented "raw" controller mode (-+raw_controller_mode=yes),
	  which means all control changes are simply stored without handling
	  e.g. RPNs or sustain pedal changes in a special way
	  do not "pollute" controller space with Csound internal data
	  cleaned up code
	* OOps/midiops.c:

2005-02-20  Michael Gogins <gogins@pipeline.com>

	* Added '--help' to short usage list.
	* Permit .orc and .sco filenames in .csd files.
	* Added Sequence node in CsoundVST:
	child nodes of a Sequence node follow each other
	in strict temporal order, in the same order that
	the child nodes were added to the Sequence;
	the duration of each node is the total duration
	of all notes that it produces.

	    CSOUND_EXITJMP_SUCCESS
          OPARMS.Midioutname on all platforms, not only BeOS
	* OOps/midisend.c:
	  Linux midiout writes to device file in non-blocking mode instead
	  of using OSS /dev/sequencer
	* Top/argdecode.c:
	  replaced redundant definitions of short option list with a single one
	  exit (longjmp) with success after --help, -z, and utility call (-U)
	  various changes to make argdecode safe to call multiple times
	  accumulate rather than overwrite --opcode-lib list
	  minor fixes, removed static variable, etc.
	* Top/csmodule.c:
	  search OPCODEDIR64 first if MYFLT=double
	* Top/csound.c:
	  on systems other than WIN32 and mills_macintosh, print messages
	  to stderr instead of stdout so that -o stdout does not get corrupted

	  removed exit() call
	  return value is zero on success, -1 on error (other utilities may
	  need similar changes)

	  a-rate rnd31 was made faster
	  improved seeding from time
	  removed all static variables (hopefully did not break anything...)

	  fixed return value in csoundAppendOpcode (should be zero on success)

2005-02-13  John ffitch  <jpff@codemist.co.uk>

	* Opcodes/uggab.c (lpshold, loopseg, loopseg_set): Changed to
	agree with csoundAV

2005-02-11  John ffitch  <jpff@codemist.co.uk>

	* Opcodes/pvsdemix.[ch]: New files from Victor Lazzarini

	* SConstruct: Added pvsdemic

2005-02-10	Istvan Varga	<istvan@csounds.com>
	* frontends/csound/csound_main.c
	* Top/argdecode.c:
	  Improved --sched option, now accepts a priority value (--sched=N).
	  Priority settings in the range 1 to 99 request the use of SCHED_RR,
	  zero is SCHED_OTHER (not real-time but still locks memory), and
	  -20 to -1 for setting nice level.
	* Opcodes/gab/vectorial.c:
	  Fixed sequence point warnings.

2005-02-10	Istvan Varga	<istvan@csounds.com>
	* InOut/rtjack:
	  Implemented JACK real time audio plugin (experimental).
	* InOut/libsnd.c:
	  Do not call audrecv() after opening sound input in sfopenin().
	* Engine/musmon.c:
	  Print correct maxamp info in cleanup(), even if performance is
	  terminated (e.g. by ^C) rather than finished normally.
	* SConstruct:
	  Added new options noDebug (do not add -g and -gstabs to CCFLAGS),
	  gcc3opt (add optimisation flags for gcc 3.3.x and later), and
	  useGprof (compile and link with -pg). All are disabled by default.
	  Changes to allow compilng JACK plugin.
	* Top/main.c:
	  Terminate (call longjmp()) if initialisation of modules has
	  failed for some reason.
	* Top/csound.c:
	  playopen_dummy() and recopen_dummy() now fail if --sched is used,
	  to avoid locking up the machine.
	  Expanded tabs to spaces.
	* Engine/oload.c:
	* H/csoundCore.h:
	* InOut/libsnd.c:
	* Top/argdecode.c:
	* Top/csound.c:
	  Use csoundGlobalVariable and csoundConfigurationVariable system
	  for new sound file ID tag options added by Michael Gogins, rather
	  than changing OPARMS, oload.c, argdecode.c, etc.
	  The options are now:
	    -+id_title
	    -+id_copyright
	    -+id_software
	    -+id_artist
	    -+id_comment
	    -+id_date
	  argdecode.c: expanded tabs to spaces

2005-02-09  Michael Gogins <gogins@pipeline.com>

	* Add long options to set ID tags in output soundfile:
	--id-title=TITLE        Title tag in output soundfile (no spaces)
	--id-copyright=COPY     Copyright tag in output soundfile (no spaces)
	--id-software=SOFTWARE  Software tag in output soundfile (no spaces)
	--id-artist=ARTIST      Artist tag in output soundfile (no spaces)
	--id-comment=COMMENT    Comment tag in output soundfile (no spaces)
	--id-date=DATE          Date tag in output soundfile (no spaces)

2005-02-07	Istvan Varga	<istvan@csounds.com>
	* Engine/insert.c:
	  Fixed uses of INSDS.xtratim where it was assumed to be short.
	* Engine/musmon.c:
	  Use ENVIRON.sensEvents_state instead of csoundGlobalVariables,
	  to reduce CPU usage of sensevents().
	* Engine/oload.c:
	* H/csoundCore.h:
	  Added GetRtRecordUserData(), GetRtPlayUserData(),
	  sensEvents_state, rtRecord_userdata, and rtPlay_userdata to
	  ENVIRON. In csoundCore.h: new structure type sensEvents_t.
	* H/csound.h:
	* Top/csound.c:
	  New functions void **csoundGetRtRecordUserData(void *csound)
	  and void **csoundGetRtPlayUserData(void *csound).
	* InOut/rtalsa.c:
	  Use user data pointers instead of csoundGlobalVariables to store
	  device instance data; reduces CPU usage.

2005-02-06	Istvan Varga	<istvan@csounds.com>
	* Engine/sread.c:
	  Fixed memory corruption bugs that were caused by mixed use of
	  mmalloc and realloc.
	* Top/main.c:
	  Fixed bug in setting cenviron.exitjmp_.
	* frontends/csound/csound_main.c:
	  Better checking for real time audio in set_rt_priority().
	* Engine/memalloc.c:
	  Rewritten functions mmalloc, mrealloc, etc.

2005-02-05	Istvan Varga	<istvan@csounds.com>
	* Engine/insert.c:
	  Reworked kperf() so that it always performs one k-period, and
	  does not check for real-time events (that is now done by
	  sensevents()).
	  beatexpire() and timexpire() take double argument instead of
	  MYFLT.
	* Engine/musmon.c:
	  Call orcompact() in cleanup().
	  Set real-time audio buffer sizes to more usable defaults.
	  Replaced sensevents() with new version that always senses
	  events for one k-period, and also handles real-time events;
	  this new implementation of sensevents is also not as prone
	  to drop notes as the original, but may still need some
	  tweaking.
	  playevents now simply calls sensevents() and kperf() in
	  a loop, to eliminate redundant code.
	  Misc. changes related to new kperf/sensevents.
	* H/csound.h:
	* Top/csound.c:
	* Top/main.c:
	  Fixes to re-entrancy bugs reported by Michael Gogins.
	  New API function: int csoundPreCompile(void *csound),
	  is optionally called before csoundCompile
	* H/prototyp.h:
	* InOut/FL_graph.cpp:
	  Changed kperf prototype to 'void kperf(ENVIRON *csound)'.
	  Global variable 'kcnt' has been removed.
	* InOut/rtpa.c:
	  Fixed bug in module selection (incorrect use of strcmp).

2005-02-03	Istvan Varga	<istvan@csounds.com>
	* SConstruct:
	  Fixed (hopefully) the PortMIDI compile error.
	* Engine/musmon.c:
	  Made it sure that cleanup() is done only once, no matter how
	  many times it is called; fixed closing sound I/O (still not
	  sure if it is correct); remove temporary files in cleanup().
	* H/prototyp.h:
	* Top/main.c:
	* Top/one_file.c:
	  add_tmpfile() and remove_tmpfiles() now take a void *csound
	  pointer to remove the temporary files of a particular Csound
	  instance. Also removed the static global variable 'toremove'.
	  In main.c, cleanup() is called instead of rtclose to close sound
	  output (cleanup is more useful as it will also close files,
	  remove temporaries, etc.).
	* InOut/libsnd.c:
	* InOut/pa_blocking.c:
	* InOut/rtalsa.c:
	* InOut/rtpa.c:
	  Incrementing ENVIRON.nrecs_ is now done in libsnd.c, and not in
	  the plugins. Closing line input was also moved to libsnd.c.
	  Fixed memory access problem in rtalsa.c (allocated space was too
	  small in some cases) that caused crashes and odd errors.
	  Attempts were made to make the closing of sound I/O more reliable;
	  this is still not perfect in the case of PortAudio, but ALSA is
	  better now.

2005-02-02	Istvan Varga	<istvan@csounds.com>

	* Top/main.c:
	* frontends/csound/csound_main.c:
	  Moved set_rt_priority() and calling of init_getstring() from main.c
	  to csound_main.c.
	  Various changes to use new interfaces.
	* H/csmodule.h:
	* Top/csmodule.c:
	  New plugin interface to be used by non-opcode libraries (e.g.
	  real time audio).
	* H/csoundCore.h:
	  Added new API functions to ENVIRON.
	* H/csound.h:
	* H/csoundCore.h:

	* SConstruct:
	  Code related to real time audio has been revised to allow for
	  loadable modules and multiple instances.
	* H/cfgvar.h:
	* Engine/cfgvar.c:

2005-02-01  John ffitch  <jpff@codemist.co.uk>

	* frontends/csound/csound_main.c (main): Corrected incorrect C

2005-01-29	Istvan Varga	<istvan@csounds.com>
	* SConstruct:
	* InOut/rtalsa.c:
	  added ALSA real-time audio; disabled by default, as it is
	  currently quite limited (no device selection, only float samples
	  are supported).

2005-01-29	Istvan Varga	<istvan@csounds.com>
	* H/csound.h, H/csoundCore.h:
	* Engine/namedins.c, Engine/oload.c, Top/csound.c:
	  new function: csoundQueryGlobalVariableNoCheck()
	  functions moved from csound.c to namedins.c

	  added void **namedGlobals, int namedGlobalsCurrLimit, and
	  int namedGlobalsMaxLimit to ENVIRON
	* Top/main.c, frontends/csound/csound_main.c:
	  print compile times (real and CPU) if bit 7 of O.msglevel is set
	* H/csound.h, Top/csound.c:
	  implemented functions for creating named global "variables"
	* OOps/aops.c: rtclock opcode uses new timer functions
	* Top/main.c:
	  print_benchmark_info(): new function (activated by O.msglevel & 128)
	  call csoundDeleteAllGlobalVariables() on RESET
	  create global timer struct that counts from Csound instance start-up;
	  use these calls to get the current real/CPU time in seconds (return
	  value is double):
	   timers_get_real_time(csoundQueryGlobalVariable(csound, "csRtClock"))
	   timers_get_CPU_time(csoundQueryGlobalVariable(csound, "csRtClock"))

2005-01-27	Istvan Varga	<istvan@csounds.com>
	* Engine/express.c, Engine/oload.c, Engine/rdorch.c, H/csoundCore.h:

	* Engine/entry2.c:
	* Engine/express.c:
	* Engine/otran.c:
	* Engine/rdorch.c:
	  use '.' instead of '_' in internal opcode names (e.g. osc.kk

	* strings/makedb.c:
	* strings/all_strings, strings/english-strings, strings/french-strings:
	* H/text.h:
	* Top/getstring.c:

	  instead of Str(X_nnnn,"..."). This also needed replacement
	  of Str() in a large number of files.
	* Engine/oload.c, Engine/otran.c, H/csoundCore.h:
	  use 'int' type for variable indexes instead of 'short';
	  needs some testing
	* Engine/oload.c, Top/main.c, Top/one_file.c:
	  removed API function prototypes, use csound.h instead
	* Top/csound.c, H/csound.h, Engine/oload.c, Engine/otran.c:
	  incorporated some changes from the 'unofficial' 4.24.1 version,
	  including timer functions, better checking of sr/kr/ksmps, and
	  some fixes
	* Engine/memalloc.c: removed references to free_strings()
	* H/csdl.h: use csoundLocalizeString() instead of getstring()

	Linux/Mach cases

2005-01-22  Michael Gogins <gogins@pipeline.com>

	* Added csoundSetFLTKThreadLocking and csoundGetFLTKThreadLocking
	calls to the Csound API. This controls whether or not the FLTK
	widget thread calls Fl::lock and Fl::unlock (the default), or not.
	Programs with their own performance thread or FLTK thread may
	wish to disable Csound's FLTK thread locking.

2005-01-20  Michael Gogins <gogins@pipeline.com>

	possible to run Csound natively from Java. This is designed
	mostly for using Csound in Mathematica through J/Link.

2004-12-19  John ff  <jpff@codemist.co.uk>

	* InOut/pmidi.c (sensMidi): major rehack for PortMIDI structure.

2004-12-02  John ffitch  <jpff@codemist.co.uk>

	* SConstruct (else): Added PortMIDI build option to aid experimentation.

2004-11-30  John ffitch  <jpff@codemist.co.uk>

	* Top/main.c (signal_handler): Move message to after check for alarm

2004-11-25  Michael Gogins <gogins@pipeline.com>

	* Initial implementation of CounterpointNode --
	generates species 1, 2, or 3 counterpoint for cantus firmi
	selected from notes generated by child nodes.
	Based on code from Bill Schottstaedt's species counterpoint generator
	(thanks, Bill!).

2004-11-16  John ffitch  <jpff@codemist.co.uk>

	* OOps/ugens2.c (itable, itabli, itabl3): Need to check OK rather
	than assume true=OK

	* Engine/fgens.c: All over removed statics into the environment or
	into arguments.  Make ftfind etc take extra argument.  Should
	assist with reentrance.

2004-11-14  John ffitch  <jpff@codemist.co.uk>

	* util2/exports/het_import.c (main): Open output as binary stream

	* Top/main.c (mainRESET): ftRESET takes environment argument

	args to gens to reflect this -- statics almost unnecessary

2004-11-11  Michael Gogins <gogins@pipeline.com>

	* Changed the Python interface to CsoundVST to allow Python
	programmers to derive new classes in Python from CsoundVST.Node,
	and these new classes will function as C++ Node * objects in the
	CsoundVST C++ internals. This enables Python-derived Nodes to
	function just like regular C++ Nodes in music graphs.

2004-11-11  John ffitch  <jpff@codemist.co.uk>

	* Engine/fgens.c: Removed static variables ftp and nargs and used

	documentation included.  There are as yet many errors with tables
	and graphics, but all (or almost all) of the text appears to be
	good.

	csound.

2004-07-23  Michael Gogins <gogins@pipeline.com>

	* Loris: added sources (for Csound 5 opcode ONLY) and prebuilt
	binaries (for MinGW/Windows with USE_DOUBLE ONLY) for _loris.dll,

       and made the messages clearer.

2004-07-21  Michael Gogins <gogins@pipeline.com>

	* vst4cs: implemented sample-accurate timing for NOTE ON and NOTE OFF.
	Renamed opcodes for greater intelligiblity.

2004-07-19  Michael Gogins <gogins@pipeline.com>
