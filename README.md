# GETTING STARTED

CsoundQt, a graphical shell for Csound, makes an excellent place to begin
the exploration of Csound, especially because CsoundQt has an extensive menu
of built-in examples that show off Csound's capabilities. Many musicians make
CsoundQt their main Csound environment, although there are other excellent
environments. CsoundQt runs not only Csound code, but also Python scripts.

The examples directory and its subdirectories contains numerous working 
Csound orchestras and even complete pieces. 

The Csound Reference Manual may be found online at 
http://csound.github.io/docs/manual/indexframes.html, or it may be installed with 
Csound in a location that varies by operating system.

This version of Csound is programmable in C, C++, JavaScript, Python, Java, Lua, 
and Common Lisp, and scores can be generated in these languages.

The Csound API application programming interfaces reference 
may be found online at http://csound.github.io/docs/api/index.html, or it may be 
installed with Csound in a location that varies by operating system. The API 
reference is generated from and for the C and C++ API, but it is also helpful when 
programming Csound in other languages.
