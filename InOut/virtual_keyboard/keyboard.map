# Custom Keyboard Map for Virtual Keyboard
# Steven Yi
#
# USAGE
#
# When using the Virtual Keyboard, you can supply a filename for a mapping
# of banks and programs via the -M flag, for example:
#
# csound -+rtmidi=virtual -Mkeyboard.map my_project.csd
#
# INFORMATION ON THE FORMAT
#
# -lines that start with '#' are comments
# -lines that have [] start new bank definitions,
#  the contents are bankNum=bankName, with bankNum=[1,16384]
# -lines following bank statements are program definitions
#  in the format programNum=programName, with programNum=[1,128]
# -bankNumbers and programNumbers are defined in this file
#  starting with 1, but are converted to midi values (starting
#  with 0) when read
#
# NOTES
#
# -if an invalid bank definition is found, all program
#  defintions that follow will be ignored until a new
#  valid bank definition is found
# -if a valid bank is defined by no valid programs found
#  for that bank, it will default to General MIDI program
#  definitions
# -if an invalid program definition is found, it will be
#  ignored
