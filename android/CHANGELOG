6.04.0 - 2014-12-01

* Android API updated: 
	* CsoundValueCacheable interface changed to CsoundBinding
	* CsoundCompletionListener interface changed to CsoundListener,
	csoundRenderStarted function added to interface
  * methods renamed: addValueCacheable => addBinding, addCompletionListener =>
	addListener
  * CsoundObj methods for adding UI and motion bindings moved to CsoundMotion
	and CsoundUI classes

6.00.1 - 2013-08-06

* Bug #26: CsoundObj: modified getInputChannelPtr to require passing in the channelType (i.e. CSOUND_CONTROL_CHANNEL, CSOUND_AUDIO_CHANNEL); previously getInputChannelPtr was hardcoded for only control channels. This is a non-backwards compatible change.  To update previous project, add "controlChannelType.CSOUND_CONTROL_CHANNEL" when calling getInputChannelPtr.

* CsoundObj: added getOutputChannelPtr method


6.00rc2 - 2013-05-23

* Warning: In Csound 5 for Android, CSD's required using "-+rtaudio=null".  In Csound 6, this must not be used or it will cause the dummy audio interface to be used, just as it does on the Desktop.  The result of this is that CSD's should be easier to use between desktop and Android.
