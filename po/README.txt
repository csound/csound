Some of the languages in the different po files use diacritic characters or
non-English alphabets. The character encoding used in the po files is UTF-8.

It is IMPERATIVE that people who modify those po files use a text editor
configured for UTF-8 character encoding. If this is not respected, special
characters would likely be lost resulting in messy translations.
