[CSOUND DEPENDENCY BUILDER SCRIPT]

These scripts can be useful if you need to build dependencies from source. There might be easier alternatives like using
package managers like homebrew/macports on OS X or the system package manager on Linux systems.

[About the Scripts]

Included are two scripts:

* download.sh - this script downloads the source files for dependencies into the cache folder, then unpacks them into the build folder.  Some dependencies are downloaded zip or tar.gz, while others are downloaded using subversion (svn).

* build.sh - this script goes into each of the dependencies in the build folder, runs the configure script, calls make, then calls "sudo make install" to install the dependencies onto your system. If a dependency is successfully built, a file called ".complete" will be written into that folder and will not be processed if the build.sh script is called again.

These scripts are for use with building dependencies on Mac OSX.  They were tested on OSX 10.8 and build all dependencies using i386 and x86_64.

[Requirements]

To build the dependencies, the following are required to install:

* wget - this is used to download packages.  This can be installed using homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), using "brew install wget"
* CMake - This can be installed using a DMG installer from http://www.cmake.org.  The version used at the time of writing this document is 2.8.10
* XCode - Installed from the Mac App Store
* XCode Command Line Tools - These are available to install from within XCode.  Open up Preferences, then go to Downloads and choose "Command Line Tools" to install.

[Notes]

* Boost is only downloaded and unpacked.  This is because the parts of boost that Csound has dependencies on are header-only dependencies and do not require linking to any libraries.  One can modify their custom.py or Custom.cmake to include this directory to have boost found.
