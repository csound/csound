/*
   There is a need for an API that supports hosted MIDI soft synths
   with GUIs in Linux audio applications.  In time the GMPI initiative
   should comprehensively address this need, but the requirement for
   Linux applications to be able to support simple hosted synths is
   here now, and GMPI is not.  This proposal (the "DSSI Soft Synth
   Interface" or DSSI, pronounced "dizzy") aims to provide a simple
   solution in a way that we hope will prove complete and compelling
   enough to support now, yet not so compelling as to supplant GMPI or
   any other comprehensive future proposal.

   For simplicity and familiarity, this API is based as far as
   possible on existing work -- the LADSPA plugin API for control
   values and audio processing, and the ALSA sequencer event types for
   MIDI event communication.  The GUI part of the proposal is quite
   new, but may also be applicable retroactively to LADSPA plugins
   that do not otherwise support this synth interface.

     * LADSPA_Plugin
     *
     * A DSSI synth plugin consists of a LADSPA plugin plus an
     * additional framework for controlling program settings and
     * transmitting MIDI events.  A plugin must fully implement the
     * LADSPA descriptor fields as well as the required LADSPA
     * functions including instantiate() and (de)activate().  It
     * should also implement run(), with the same behaviour as if
     * run_synth() (below) were called with no synth events.
     *
     * In order to instantiate a synth the host calls the LADSPA
     * instantiate function, passing in this LADSPA_Descriptor
     * pointer.  The returned LADSPA_Handle is used as the argument
     * for the DSSI functions below as well as for the LADSPA ones.

    /**
     * configure()
     *
     * This member is a function pointer that sends a piece of
     * configuration data to the plugin.  The key argument specifies
     * some aspect of the synth's configuration that is to be changed,
     * and the value argument specifies a new value for it.  A plugin
     * that does not require this facility at all may set this member
     * to NULL.
     *
     * This call is intended to set some session-scoped aspect of a
     * plugin's behaviour, for example to tell the plugin to load
     * sample data from a particular file.  The plugin should act
     * immediately on the request.  The call should return NULL on
     * success, or an error string that may be shown to the user.  The
     * host will free the returned value after use if it is non-NULL.
     *
     * Calls to configure() are not automated as timed events.
     * Instead, a host should remember the last value associated with
     * each key passed to configure() during a given session for a
     * given plugin instance, and should call configure() with the
     * correct value for each key the next time it instantiates the
     * "same" plugin instance, for example on reloading a project in
     * which the plugin was used before.  Plugins should note that a
     * host may typically instantiate a plugin multiple times with the
     * same configuration values, and should share data between
     * instances where practical.
     *
     * Calling configure() completely invalidates the program and bank
     * information last obtained from the plugin.
     *
     * Reserved and special key prefixes
     * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     * The DSSI: prefix
     * ----------------
     * Configure keys starting with DSSI: are reserved for particular
     * purposes documented in the DSSI specification.  At the moment,
     * there is one such key: DSSI:PROJECT_DIRECTORY.  A host may call
     * configure() passing this key and a directory path value.  This
     * indicates to the plugin and its UI that a directory at that
     * path exists and may be used for project-local data.  Plugins
     * may wish to use the project directory as a fallback location
     * when looking for other file data, or as a base for relative
     * paths in other configuration values.
     *
     * The GLOBAL: prefix
     * ------------------
     * Configure keys starting with GLOBAL: may be used by the plugin
     * and its UI for any purpose, but are treated specially by the
     * host.  When one of these keys is used in a configure OSC call
     * from the plugin UI, the host makes the corresponding configure
     * call (preserving the GLOBAL: prefix) not only to the target
     * plugin but also to all other plugins in the same instance
     * group, as well as their UIs.  Note that if any instance
     * returns non-NULL from configure to indicate error, the host
     * may stop there (and the set of plugins on which configure has
     * been called will thus depend on the host implementation).
     * See also the configure OSC call documentation in RFC.txt.

     * function, except that it also supplies events to the synth.
     *

     * sequencer events, which is used to communicate MIDI and related
     * events to the synth.  Each event is timestamped relative to the
     * start of the block, (mis)using the ALSA "tick time" field as a
     * frame count. The host is responsible for ensuring that events
     * with differing timestamps are already ordered by time.

     * ladpsa.h, in the context of the LADSPA run() function.
     *
     * Note Events
     * ~~~~~~~~~~~
     * There are two minor requirements aimed at making the plugin
     * writer's life as simple as possible:
     *
     * 1. A host must never send events of type SND_SEQ_EVENT_NOTE.
     * Notes should always be sent as separate SND_SEQ_EVENT_NOTE_ON
     * and NOTE_OFF events.  A plugin should discard any one-point
     * NOTE events it sees.
     *
     * 2. A host must not attempt to switch notes off by sending
     * zero-velocity NOTE_ON events.  It should always send true
     * NOTE_OFFs.  It is the host's responsibility to remap events in
     * cases where an external MIDI source has sent it zero-velocity
     * NOTE_ONs.
     *
     * Bank and Program Events
     * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     * Hosts must map MIDI Bank Select MSB and LSB (0 and 32)
     * controllers and MIDI Program Change events onto the banks and
     * programs specified by the plugin, using the DSSI select_program
     * call.  No host should ever deliver a program change or bank
     * select controller to a plugin via run_synth.
