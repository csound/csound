BEFORE COMPILING

To generate the source code for the Python opcodes just run the

pycall-gen.py

and

pyx-gen.py

scripts in this directory.

NOTES

These opcodes require the Python virtual machine to be initialized, which 
can be done by putting the "pyinit" opcode in the orchestra header.

If you write your composition as a Python script in CsoundVST, you can write
classes for your composition in that script and embed your Csound orchestras
and scores in the script using Python triple quotes ('''). Therefore, the
{{ and }} directives are not necessary if you use CsoundVST.
