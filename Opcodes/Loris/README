MICHAEL GOGINS FOR CSOUND 5
23 July 2004

For more information about Loris, please see http://loris.sourceforge.net.

I have modified the two lorisgens.h and lorisgens.C files to build and run 
with csound5, and I have placed a prebuilt _loris.dll in the csound5
directory. This is a Dev-C++ (MinGW) build for Windows with USE_DOUBLE
defined.

_loris.dll is a Csound plugin opcode, and it is also a Python extension 
module (along with loris.py, also committed in csound5 along with the 
morphdemo.py demonstration, though to run it you will need source files 
from Loris CVS on SourceForge).

The Dev-C++ project file has also been committed. You could adapt this
project file to build Loris without USE_DOUBLE, or to find out how to 
modify the Loris build system to build for csound 5 on Linux or other platforms.
Note that sources, libraries, and headers will all likely be in different 
places on your system.


KELLY FITZ FOR CSOUND 4

This document outlines the steps necessary to add Loris unit generators
to Csound. You will need, in addition to Loris and the libraries on
which it depends (FFTW), a copy of the Csound source code, available at, 
for example

  ftp://ftp.maths.bath.ac.uk/pub/dream

or

  ftp://ftp.musique.umontreal.ca/pub/mirrors/dream

Some versions of Csound (on some platforms) support dynamically-
loaded modules, using the --opcode-lib command line flag. On these 
platforms, Loris can be configured to automatically build a 
dynamically-loadable module by using the --with-csound flag with
the configure script to specify a path to the csound source code.
For example:

  ./configure  --with-csound=/usr/local/src/Csound-4.23

Since the lorisgens code needs to include a header that is part
of the Csound source code, you must have the Csound source code,
and you must specify its location using the --with-csound flag
when configuring Loris. Otherwise, the lorisgens module is not
built. 

The remainder of this document describes the method for adding 
the Loris generators to Csound by rebuilding the Csound program
from source code. 

The Loris unit generators make use of some recent improvements to the
Csound extension API (such as deinitialization routines and support for
modules written in C++), so before you begin, make sure that your
version of the Csound source is newer than version 4.17. Version 4.18
seems to work fine. Also, of course, make sure that you can build csound
from your copy of the source before you attempt to add the new Loris
modules.

Adding lorisgens to Csound:

Step 1: Introduce the Loris unit generators into entry1.c or entry2.c:

a) Add
  
  #include "lorisgens.h"Ê 

to the list of headers included at top of file.

b) Add declarations for the functions invoked directly by the Loris unit
generators:

void lorisread_setup(void*);  
void lorisread(void*);
void lorisplay_setup(void*);
void lorisplay(void*);
void lorismorph_setup(void*);
void lorismorph(void*);

must be added to the list of function definitions found after all the
#include statements.


c) Add the Loris unit generator to the opcode list by adding:

{"lorisread",  S(LORISREAD),  3, "",  "kSikkko", lorisread_setup,  lorisread, NULL },
{"lorisplay",  S(LORISPLAY),  5, "a", "ikkk",    lorisplay_setup,  NULL, lorisplay },
{"lorismorph", S(LORISMORPH), 3, "",  "iiikkk",  lorismorph_setup, lorismorph, NULL }
 
to the array of similar OENTRY structures.


Step 2: Modify the Makefile (there are several, make sure to modify the
one you use in your csound build!) to compile and link the Loris unit
generator source, and to link in the loris library.

a) Add the Loris unit generator source code to the list of sources:

LORISSRC = lorisgens.C

and add $(LORISSRC) to list of sources CSRCS.

b) Add the Loris unit generator object file to the list of objects used
to link the csound binary:

LORISOBJ = lorisgens.o

and add $(LORISOBJ) to list of objects COBJS.

c) Add the Loris unit generator header to the list of headers by adding
lorisgens.h to list of headers HDRS.

d) Add the Loris C++ headers 
path (usually /usr/local/include/loris, but depending on the prefix
you used when building Loris) to the header search path. This can be accomplished
by adding something like

  -I/usr/local/include/loris

(substituting the correct path if necessary) to the definition of CFLAGS.

e) Add the loris library to the list of libraries LIBS. This can be accomplished
by adding 

  -lloris
  
and possibly (if you are using a platform like Darwin, for which shared versions
of the SDIF library are not available in the standard distribution)

  -lsdif
  
to the definition of LIBS. If you have used a nonstandard prefix, say /opt, for building the
Loris library, you may also need to add something like 

  -L/opt/lib
  
to the LIB definition.

You may also need to add

	-lstdc++

to the LIB definition to include the standard C++ library (it may
have a different name if you are not using a GNU C/C++ compiler).

f) Finally, add a rule for compiling c++ source files. The following should do:

.C.o:
	$(CXX) $(CFLAGS) -c $*.C


Step 3: Build and install csound, and start enjoying the Loris unit generators.
