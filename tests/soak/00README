This directory contains a soak test -- about 700 test sof Csound and
it runs for a long time. 

The idea is to run 
    runtests.py
which creates two significant files

1:  Checksums
    This should be the same as SAFESums, which is the default md5s of
    the audio

2:  Output1
    The printed messages, which should compare with Old_Output

The file Sample_Checksums is what my computer produces.  Yours may
vary.

To deploy these tests

1: run runtest.py

2: copy Checksums to SAFESums

3: copy Output1 to Old_Output

When run there should be no differences between Checksums and SAFESums
and only minor ones between Output1 and Old_Output
