The files in this directory are concerned with hetrodyne filter analysis
of sound, and the formation of control files for Csound reconstruction
using ADSYN.
The analysis program takes only integer sound samples, such as are produced
by the standalone 'sndin' utility.  Compiling and running that utility
requires the UCSD/carl support programs (see ../../utils/sndin.dir).

The ADSYN unit is not in final form.  I expect to be changing the control
format at some time, merging it with fuller phase vocoder analysis
still later in the future.
